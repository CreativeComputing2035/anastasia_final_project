Initally I was working on a non-linear website, that was quite abstract. I created a few differnt functions using the jquery we've learned this semester. I then decided that I would do my portfolio in a different way. 

What I attempted to accomplish was to have one html file(index) that would hold everything and hide and show based on clicks.

When you click on the photo within a project, a new photo should appear from that same project.

My issue was that the images we're being hidden again, and the clicks were stacking on one another.
